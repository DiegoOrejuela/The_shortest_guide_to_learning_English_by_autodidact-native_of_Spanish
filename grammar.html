         <h1>Grammar</h1>
          <p>Grammar will be the most appropriate language component to start learning a language in an adult age, as explained at the beginning of this blog. We will review its definition and will delve into its two major areas: morphology and syntactic. </p>

          <h2>Definition</h2>
           <p>Grammar is the group of principles, rules and precepts that govern the use of a particular language. It treats its elementary components and the combinations that exist between them. In simpler words, it deals with the structure and rules of the relationship between signs. Therefore, each language usually has its own grammar. </p>

          <h2>Components</h2>
           <p>Because the part of the language it deals with is too broad, a thematic division has been identified in two areas: </p>

            <h3 class="center">Morphology</h3>
             <p class="minuscenter">from the Greek morphe (form) and logia (treaty or study) </p>
             <p>It addresses the internal structure of words and their training process. The word is the minimum unit of meaning of a language, and two parts can be found in it: </p>
             <ul>
               <li><h4>Lexeme</h4></li>
             </ul>
                <p class="indent">basic and invariable morph. It is considered its root.</p>
                  <p class="centerital"><u>Cat</u><br>
                                        <u>Cat</u>s<br>
                                        <u>Cat</u>ling</p>
              <ul>
               <li><h4>Gramema</h4></li>
              </ul>
                <p class="indent">Morph that constitutes the variable part. 
                  <p class="centerital">Cat<br>  
                                        Cat<u>s</u> <br>
                                        Cat<u>ling</u> </p>
            

            <h3 class="center">Syntactic</h3>
             <p class="minuscenter">from Greek without (with), taxis (order) and -tico (relative to) </p>
             <p>His focus is on the order and combination of words to form sentences and phrases that allow two entities to send messages. Let's see an example to understand it better: </p>
              <p class="centerital">go Carol doesn't the cinema to<br><br>
                                    Carol doesn't go to the cinema. </p>
             <p>In the first statement we know the meanings of each word used, but we can not get any message. In the second, due to the order and the correct combination of the words, we can deduce a message. </p>
             <p>To achieve construct messages, the syntactic classifies the words according to their function: </p>
              <ul>
                <li><h4>Noun or substantive</h4></li>
              </ul>
                 <p class="minusleft">from Latin substantia (essence) </p>
                 <p class="indent">Name people, living beings, things, events, places or abstract concepts. </p>
                  <p class="centerital">Maria<br>
                                        Dog<br>
                                        Tables<br>
                                        Christmas<br>
                                        London<br>
                                        Love</p>
              <ul>
                <li><h4>Article</h4></li>
              </ul>
                 <p class="minusleft">from the Latin Articulus (joint, member) </p>
                 <p class="indent">The article is the variable part of the sentence that always accompanies a noun, to express mainly its gender, its number and its grammatical person. </p>
                  <p class="centerital">the<br>

              <ul>
                <li><h4>Adjective</h4></li>
              </ul>
                 <p class="minusleft">from the Latin ad- (next to, to), the verb iacere (assign) and the suffix -tivo (indicates active or passive relationship) </p>
                 <p class="indent">Assign or mark assignments to the noun. Qualifies or determines the properties and characteristics of the noun, pronouns and even other adjectives. </p>

                                      Tall <br>
                                      Nice</p>
              <ul>
                <li><h4>Pronoun</h4></li>
              </ul>
                 <p class="minusleft">from Latin pronomen, formed from the prefix pro- (in place of) and nomen (name) </p>
                 <p class="indent">They replace "or" are equivalent "to a name or noun, when this is already known or has been indicated, in most cases. </p>

              <ul>
                <li><h4>Verb</h4></li>
              </ul>
                 <p class="minusleft">from Latin verbum (word) and from the Indo-European root weriga (call, summon) </p>

<p>Any speaker of any language in the world, with or without studies, has a grammatical knowledge as implicit knowledge. That is to say, he has mastered a series of rules that govern his way of speaking, but he does not know that he knows them. This implicit grammatical knowledge can be made explicit through introspection and observation.
I'll tell you a little about how that process has been for me.
