         <h1>My experience</h1>
          <p>I will share a bit of my learning process.</p>
          <p>I am someone who, in most cases, to start something has to have clear concepts. It is an imperative for me. So for about two weeks I devoted myself to understand language as an abstract object.</p>
          <p>I consulted about the meaning of language and its components, and delved into the area that would allow me to improve or learn a language taking into account my abilities. I think that without some knowledge that I learned in my Spanish class at school, this process would have been more difficult.</p>
          <p>Then I addressed the classification of words made by syntax, and here I would like to share a sample of my annotations. To understand the types of pronouns that may exist in English and Spanish, I elaborated the following tables:</p>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/yg2cr6v/Pronoun1.jpg">
          <br><br>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/WzwdQcp/Pronoun2.jpg">
          <br><br>
          <p>Wait! I know the colors are fatal, but let me explain the meaning. The color that looks more like red, symbolizes the sun (singular) and the one that looks like green to the trees (plural). The fatality of the colors belongs more to the fact that the tables were only for me. I know that I could improve them for this publication, but I wanted to leave them so that they were as faithful as possible to the process. And of course I hope that someone can serve them.</p>
          <p>At this moment I am going to cover the subject of verbs, and as you may have noticed, I still have to improve my English. However, it is <b>with this way of learning that I have felt great, because I am supporting myself in a huge community of people willing to help with knowledge and ideas, without ranks or titles, only with their enthusiasm and work.</b></p>
          <p>And you, what do you expect to learn in community?</p>
